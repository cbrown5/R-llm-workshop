# Quality statistics with large language models

CJ Brown

Perspective article

Aim for environmental sciences journal, e.g. Methods in Ecology and Evolution or Environmental Modelling and Software

Aim for 2000-3000 words

## Abstract
write this last

## Introduction

- discuss rising use of LLms in science workflows
- Identiyf problem of ensuring statistical quality is maintained and improved in sciences
- Discuss Previous literature on LLM response evaluations
- Previous literature has identified that LLMs aren't as good as recommending stats as they are in other fields
- This perspective will provide guidance on good prompting practices to ensure quality stats recommendaions, and code implementation

## Current status of quality statistics in environmental sciences

Need to review litearture before writing this section. Look at recent reviews on quality of stats in different fields. 

## Opportunity for LLMs to improve stats, if they are used correctly

Discuss opportunity

## LLM overview

cover the jargon, how they work, tokens, context window temperature, models etc.... 

## Prompting guidelines best practices

### Recognizing different steps in workflows

### Statistical advice

### Code implementation advice

## Discussion and conclusion

Short discussion on opportunity and challenges

Research needs
- more evaluations of response quality, especialy in environmental stats
