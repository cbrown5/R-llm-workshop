In my experience, effective prompts actually need to be quite long. Of course short prompts can often work for what you are trying to do, but depending on the use-case they might also be really detailed (like the system prompts for Cline or Roo for example). In this draft mostly small prompts are presented which could potentially bias readers into thinking that all prompts can be that short. 

I wonder if it would be worth having an example prompt and for each prompt improvement principle, perhaps show the with and without version of outputs? This could go in the supplement perhaps?

Also, just an awareness of the system prompts and custom instructions that are embedded in these things would be important for readers to be aware of.
