# Best practices project setup

How to be organized to maximise LLM effectiveness. Version control.

This chapter focuses on establishing an optimal project structure and workflow to get the most out of LLMs in your R projects:

## Project organization

- Directory structures that facilitate LLM assistance
- Documentation practices that improve LLM understanding of your code
- Naming conventions and code organization principles
- Creating effective README files and project documentation

## Version control with Git

- Basic Git workflow for R projects
- How version control enhances collaboration with LLMs
- Using Git to track changes made with LLM assistance
- Best practices for committing LLM-generated code

## R project setup

- Using RStudio projects or VSCode workspaces
- Setting up reproducible environments with renv or packrat
- Creating and maintaining package dependency documentation
- Organizing data, code, and output directories

By implementing these best practices, you'll create a development environment where LLMs can provide more accurate and contextually relevant assistance, leading to more efficient and reliable R programming workflows.
