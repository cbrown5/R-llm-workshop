# Code and inline completions 

## 1. Code completion

This is only option supported in Rstudio (last time I checked). 

Example: 

Show how this works. How to get it moving on when its stuck in a loop. 
Show how to use comments to get it to work more effectively 

## 2. Inline code generation

cmd/cntrl-i . Show how to use this 
examples: 
selecting code to fix 
selecting code to explain 
Use of /fix, /document etc... as shortcuts to get it to do things.

Note options for microphone, @ (shortcuts) and model choices
