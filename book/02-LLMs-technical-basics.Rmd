# LLMs technical basics 

Just use turtle lit review blog for this section. 
But add a bit more about exploring different LLM settings like temperature, different models etc...

Cover secret keys and APIs, system vs user, temperature, model selection, prompting for structured data, zero-shot vs one-shot vs few-shot prompting. Get students to devise prompts. 

Also explain ellmer extensions: We won't cover this today, but mention using ellmer to get structured data, using ellmer to make tools. Link to my blogs on this

Also show some examples of getting good quality stats advice from LLMs. (ask for multiple examples, ask it to self-evaluate answers)
