# Inline code editing

This chapter explores techniques for using GitHub Copilot's inline code editing capabilities to enhance your R programming workflow:

## 1. Code completion

This is only option supported in Rstudio (last time I checked). 

Example: 

Show how this works. How to get it moving on when its stuck in a loop. 
Show how to use comments to get it to work more effectively 

## 2. Inline code generation

cmd/cntrl-i . Show how to use this 
examples: 
selecting code to fix 
selecting code to explain 
Use of /fix, /document etc... as shortcuts to get it to do things.

Note options for microphone, @ (shortcuts) and model choices

- Accepting, modifying, or rejecting suggestions effectively
- Keyboard shortcuts and efficiency tips

## Guiding Copilot with comments

- Writing effective comments to steer Copilot's suggestions
- Using natural language to describe your coding intentions
- Documenting complex statistical procedures for better suggestions
- Balancing detail and brevity in comments

## Common patterns for R programming

- Data manipulation with tidyverse
- Statistical modeling and analysis
- Data visualization with ggplot2
- Working with specialized R packages

## Troubleshooting and refinement

- Strategies when Copilot provides incorrect or suboptimal suggestions
- Iterative refinement of code with Copilot's assistance
- Handling R-specific syntax and idioms
- Adapting to Copilot's learning curve

Through practical examples and hands-on exercises, you'll learn to seamlessly integrate Copilot's inline suggestions into your R coding process, significantly accelerating your development while maintaining code quality.
