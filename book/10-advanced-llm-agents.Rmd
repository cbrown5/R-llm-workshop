# Advanced LLM agents

**Time:** 3:00-3:30pm

**Software requirements:** VScode with R, Roo code, API license.

We'll take a quick look at [Roo Code](https://docs.roocode.com/) and its customization options. 

Roo code is more complex and expensive to use than copilot, but allows significant amounts of customization to make bespoke agents that can help with the scientific process. 

I'll use an example with the Benthic Data analysis (benthic-readme.md). 

Talk through:

- API access
- Model options
- Customizing system message
- Context window management
- Cost
- Vision capabilities
