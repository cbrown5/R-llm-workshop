# Part 3: Advanced LLM agents

**Time:** 3:00-3:30pm

**Software requirements:** VScode with R, Roo code, API license.

This chapter introduces advanced LLM agents that go beyond GitHub Copilot's capabilities:

## Evolution of LLM agents

- How LLM agents differ from simple code completion tools
- The spectrum of automation in LLM-assisted programming
- Understanding agent architectures and capabilities
- Current state-of-the-art in LLM agents for R programming

## Agent capabilities for R

- Code generation and modification
- Reasoning about complex statistical problems
- Autonomous debugging and error correction
- Documentation and explanation generation

## Integration with R workflows

- Connecting agents to your development environment
- API-based interactions with LLM agents
- Batch processing vs. interactive assistance
- Combining multiple agents for complex tasks

## Practical considerations

- Computational requirements and performance
- Cost structures and optimization strategies
- Privacy and security implications
- Evaluating agent output quality

This chapter provides a foundation for understanding more sophisticated LLM agents, preparing you for the next chapter's focus on Roo code as a specific implementation of advanced agent technology for R programming.
