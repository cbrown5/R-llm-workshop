# Advanced prompting

We'll continue with our chatbot to make it a specialist in statistics. We'll learn some advanced prompting skills like structured data, parsing and tool construction.

This chapter builds on the fundamentals to explore more sophisticated prompting techniques:

- Creating prompts that generate structured data (JSON, CSV, etc.)
- Techniques for parsing and processing LLM outputs in R
- Building tools that leverage LLMs for specific statistical tasks
- Chain-of-thought prompting for complex reasoning
- Few-shot learning and example-based prompting

Through practical examples, you'll learn how to:

- Guide LLMs to provide responses in specific formats that are easy to process with R
- Create reusable prompting templates for common statistical tasks
- Implement error handling and validation for LLM outputs
- Combine multiple prompts to solve complex problems

These advanced techniques will help you create more reliable and effective LLM-powered tools for your R workflows, particularly for statistical analysis and data science tasks.
