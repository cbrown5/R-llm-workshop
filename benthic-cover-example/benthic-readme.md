# Benthic Cover Analysis with Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)

## Introduction
This project analyzes benthic cover survey data to visualize patterns in ecological communities across different sites. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) will be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and reveal underlying patterns in site dispersion.

## Steps
1. Import and clean benthic cover survey data from multiple sites
2. Calculate dissimilarity matrices based on benthic cover composition
3. Perform MDS analysis to visualize site dispersion in ordination space
4. Identify ecological patterns and potential groupings of sites
5. Assess the stress value to determine the reliability of the MDS representation
6. Explore environmental factors that may explain the observed patterns

## Data Example
Data is structured with sites and transects as rows. Code is the type of benthic organism. Cover is the percentage cover of that organism at each site. The data is in long format

``
"site","trans","code","cover","n.pts"
1,1,"ACB",4,75
1,1,"ACE",2,75
1,1,"ACD",1,75

Here's teh data source, on github: 

```
data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbrown5/BenthicLatent/refs/heads/master/data-raw/BenthicCoverSurveys.csv"

```

## R preferences
I want to use tidyverse and vegan packages for data manipulation and analysis. I also want to use ggplot2 for data visualization.
